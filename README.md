# Spell-SimCLR

## Agenda
We are going to implement SimCLR from scratch which will allow you better to understand how the framework is arranged using PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning Frameworks as well as such architectures as ResNet and EfficientNet. 

I kindly encourage you to familiarize yourself with both of the papers and original Google AI blog post as well which are indicated in the references at the end of the tutorial.
